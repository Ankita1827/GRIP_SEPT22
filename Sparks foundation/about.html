    <h1>Our Story!</h1>
    <div class="one">
    <h2>S.P.A.R.K.S. = Science Projects are Really Kids’ Stuff!</h2>
    <p>Founded by Jennifer Moorehead in 2003, we are a 501(c )3 non-profit education organization dedicated to promoting
        science literacy to elementary age children through hands-on programs that provide enrichment in every area of
        science. In doing so, we are able to further our communities’ efforts to educate our children in STEM (Science,
        Technology, Engineering & Math) by providing additional resources for schools, as well as beyond the classroom.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="two">
    <h2>How We Got Our Start</h2>
    <p>The S.P.A.R.K.S. Foundation was formed 19 years ago in order to honor Jennifer “Jupiter Jen” Moorehead’s late
        husband, and to answer a critical need for quality, inquiry-based science programs for every child. “Jupiter
        Jen”, founder of Science Explorers, saw that her own children’s elementary school was cutting science
        instruction time and budgets, and that the students’ proficiency levels in the subject were dropping as a
        result. She knew from her own experience as a parent how well children learned and enjoyed science if they could
        learn it ‘hands-on’ and she wanted to bring that type of science education to other elementary grade students.
    </p>
    <p>Jennifer also learned how many other schools were hungry for more high-quality hands-on STEM learning
        opportunities yet could not afford the cost, nor did they have the resources or sufficient staffing. And so The
        S.P.A.R.K.S. Foundation was formed as a 501(c )3 non-profit organization to create partnerships for such
        programs in schools as well as for those beyond the school day. We provide the STEM learning opportunities that
        are so important to students’ future success.

        As a result of our hands-on approach, students’ proficiency levels have improved, teachers feel supported, and
        community partners see the positive impact in their community when we create lifetime learners.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="three">
    <h2>What we aim to accomplish:</h2>
    <p>Inspire lifelong engagement in science at a critical time in young students’ lives.
        Encourage students to ask questions, think critically and become problem-solving individuals.
        Provide interactive, hands-on learning opportunities in Science, Technology, Engineering & Math that extend and
        enhance the traditional elementary science curriculum.
        Collaborate with the educational community to strengthen STEM skills for students as future workers in an
        increasingly STEM-oriented world.
        Create a safe environment for expanding young students’ comfort with and mastery of the natural world around
        them.</p>
